# Why is the Penman-Monteith Method Considered the Best for Estimating Crop Water Requirements?

##  Introduction

Water is the essence of life and the most valuable resource for agriculture and the survival of green spaces. But have you ever wondered exactly how much water a plant needs? The answer to this question lies in a complex phenomenon called **Evapotranspiration (ET)**. In this article, we will explain in simple terms what evapotranspiration is and why the **FAO Penman-Monteith** method is recognized as the gold standard for calculating it.

##  What is Evapotranspiration and Why is Measuring It Important?

In short, evapotranspiration is the sum of two distinct processes:
**Evaporation:** The process where water turns into vapor from the soil surface or moist plant surfaces.

**Transpiration:** The process where water is absorbed by plant roots and then released back into the atmosphere through the stomata (pores) in the leaves.

The sum of these two processes represents the true water requirement of a plant. An accurate estimation of ET is vital for optimal irrigation management, preventing water waste, and ensuring plant health. However, this estimation is not a simple task.

## The Great Challenge: The Complexity of Factors Affecting Evapotranspiration 
The rate of evapotranspiration is a highly non-linear and complex phenomenon that depends on multiple factors:

**Climatic Factors:** Temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.

**Crop Factors:** The type of plant, its growth stage, density, and height.
This complexity has driven scientists to search for formulas and models to estimate this phenomenon with ever-increasing accuracy.

## FAO Penman-Monteith: The Global Standard for Estimating ET

Among the dozens of methods that have been developed, the **FAO-56 Penman-Monteith** method holds a special place. This method, endorsed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) as the global standard, is built upon a very strong theoretical foundation.

Unlike simpler methods that might rely solely on temperature or solar radiation, the Penman-Monteith equation simultaneously incorporates **all key climatic factors** (temperature, humidity, wind, and radiation) into its calculations. This comprehensive approach ensures that its results have the highest accuracy across various global climates when compared to actual measurements (which are taken with precise instruments called **lysimeters**).

## What Does the Research Say? Confirmation of Penman-Monteith’s Superiority
A vast body of scientific research, both in Iran and globally, has confirmed the superiority of this method:

<strong>International Research:</strong> Jensen et al. (1990), after evaluating 20 different methods across 11 global locations, concluded that Penman-Monteith performed best in all climates. López-Urrea et al. (2006), in a study in Spain, identified it as the most accurate model for semi-arid climates.


<strong>Research in Iran:</strong> Abedi et al. (1999), in a comparison with actual measurements for grass, demonstrated that the FAO Penman-Monteith equation provides the most accurate results.


<strong>Multiple Studies in Iran:</strong> Research conducted in various regions of Iran, such as Isfahan (2014), Sepidan (2015), and Mazandaran (2011), have all established Penman-Monteith as the reference (benchmark) method for evaluating other estimation techniques.

The findings from this research indicate that other methods are considered reliable only if they show a high correlation with the results from the Penman-Monteith method.

##  Is Penman-Monteith Always the Best Option? Special Conditions and Solutions

Despite its high credibility, using this method presents one significant challenge: **the need for a complete set of meteorological data** (temperature, humidity, wind, and radiation). Many weather stations do not measure all of these parameters. What should be done in such situations?



<h3> Alternative Methods for Limited Data:</h3>
<p>Research, such as a study conducted in Khuzestan (2006), has shown that it is possible to solve the Penman-Monteith equation with acceptable accuracy using minimal data (like temperature and wind speed) and applying empirical relationships (a method known as MPR - Modified Penman-Monteith for Reduced data). These approaches perform significantly better than simpler models like Hargreaves.</p>


<h3> Special Greenhouse Conditions: </h3>
<p>The controlled environment of a greenhouse differs from open-field conditions. An interesting study in Mahan (1394 [2015 AD]) revealed that under the specific greenhouse conditions of that region, the simpler FAO-24 Radiation method performed better than the Penman-Monteith method. This indicates that for specialized environments, it may be necessary to calibrate and select models that are specifically suited to those conditions.</p>

##  Conclusion: The Smart Choice for Water Management
The scientific evidence clearly shows that the **FAO Penman-Monteith** method, due to its comprehensive nature and strong scientific basis, is the most accurate and reliable tool for estimating reference evapotranspiration and crop water needs under standard conditions. It serves as a **“gold standard”** against which all other methods are measured. However, in regions facing a scarcity of meteorological data, it is possible to use modified versions of the Penman-Monteith method or other validated methods (such as combination and radiation-based methods) that have been calibrated to local conditions.

Ultimately, accurately understanding and calculating the water requirements of plants is the first and most crucial step toward achieving <strong>sustainable agriculture</strong> and <strong>intelligent water resource management</strong> .
