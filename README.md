## 1. Key Features

### **Land and Sub-unit Management**
- You can divide your agricultural land into smaller sub-units.
- These sub-units can include orchards, crop plots, or any other section that requires separate management.
- This segmentation allows you to manage and control each part of your land individually.

### **Geospatial Information (WebGIS)**
- The "WebKesht" system utilizes precise maps and a Geographic Information System (GIS).
- You can use the tools available on the map to draw and edit the boundaries of your lands and sub-units.
- This helps you maintain a clear visual representation of your assets.

### **IoT Device Management**
- The system allows you to connect Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as sensors or irrigation valves, to each sub-unit.
- This enables you to view the real-time status of each sensor and valve and control them remotely.

### **Flow Diagram Visualization**
- "WebKesht" allows you to visually draw and view flow diagrams and schematics of your irrigation networks.
- This tool helps you easily understand the connections and relationships between sub-units and equipment.
